## Branching in GitHub
Branching allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.

## Branch Naming Rules
- Use descriptive and consistent names.

**Examples:**
- `feature/your-feature-name`
- `bugfix/issue-number-description`
- `hotfix/critical-fix`

## Branching and Pushing Tutorial
1. **Create a new branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
2. **Make changes and add them:**
    ```bash
    git add .
3. **Commit your changes:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "add feature description"
4. **Push to the repository:**
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
## Commit Message Guidelines
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature").
- Use only lowercase letters.
- Keep messages clear and concise; avoid unnecessary long messages and keep it simple.
- Reference issues when relevant (e.g., "fix #123 issue with login").
